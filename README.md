# Robot AI Project

## Setup Instructions

### Downloading the Model
1. Download the model file (`.pth`) and its corresponding hash file (`.txt`) from the **Releases** section: [Robot_AI_Trained_Model](https://github.com/IsmaTIBU/PatotIA/releases/tag/Robot_AI_TrainedModel).
2. Place both files in the `Backend/models` folder of the project.
3. To verify the model was loaded correctly, run `python verify_model` in your terminal.

### Execution Steps
From the root of the cloned directory, run these commands:

1. `pip install -r required.txt`
2. `cd .\Backend`
3. `python .\api.py`

## Expected Output
After running the commands, you should see the following output in your terminal (it may take some time):

```
